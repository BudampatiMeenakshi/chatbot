## 🧠 Technical Explanation

### RAG Pipeline
1. **Document ingestion** — PDF/DOCX is loaded and split into chunks of 512 characters with 100 character overlap
2. **Embedding** — each chunk is converted to a vector using `all-mpnet-base-v2` running locally
3. **Storage** — vectors are stored in ChromaDB with metadata (page numbers)
4. **Retrieval** — MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance) retrieves top 6 relevant chunks
5. **Generation** — Groq LLM generates answer using ONLY retrieved chunks

### Hallucination Prevention
Three layers of protection:
- **Layer 1** — Prompt injection guard blocks malicious inputs before reaching LLM
- **Layer 2** — Strict system prompt instructs LLM to use ONLY document context
- **Layer 3** — Temperature = 0 removes randomness from LLM responses

### Conversation Memory
Chat history is maintained per session using an in-memory dictionary. Each session stores HumanMessage and AIMessage objects that are passed to the LLM as context on every request.

### MMR Retrieval
Instead of basic similarity search, MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance) is used to retrieve chunks that are both relevant AND diverse. This prevents returning duplicate or near-duplicate chunks and improves answer quality.

### Confidence Scoring
Based on the minimum similarity distance score:
- `very_high` — score < 0.5
- `high` — score < 1.0
- `medium` — score < 1.5
- `low` — score >= 1.5

## 📋 Production Checklist

- [ ] Get Groq API key from https://console.groq.com
- [ ] Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in production environment
- [ ] Configure CORS for your domain:
  ```python
  allow_origins=["https://your-domain.com"]
  ```
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificate (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Configure logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Load test the API
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Create incident response plan

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Check if port 8000 is in use
lsof -i :8000

# Kill process
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Check if backend is running: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`
- Check CORS headers: Open DevTools → Network tab
- Verify `API_BASE` in `frontend/src/api/chatApi.js`

### Document upload fails
- Check file size (max recommended: 50MB)
- Verify file format (PDF or DOCX only)
- Check disk space: `df -h`
- View backend logs for errors

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Groq instead of OpenAI?
```
Groq provides a completely free tier with no credit card required. The `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model delivers excellent performance comparable to GPT-4 for document Q&A tasks.
```
### Why local embeddings instead of API embeddings?
```
Using `all-mpnet-base-v2` from HuggingFace runs completely locally with no API calls, no rate limits, and no cost. It also provides better semantic accuracy than smaller API-based models.
```
### Why MMR retrieval instead of basic similarity?
```
Basic similarity search can return duplicate or near-duplicate chunks. MMR balances relevance with diversity, ensuring the LLM receives varied context from different parts of the document.
```
### Why ChromaDB?
```
ChromaDB runs locally with zero configuration, persists data between restarts, and integrates natively with LangChain. No external service required.
```
### Why temperature = 0?
```
Setting temperature to 0 makes the LLM fully deterministic — it always picks the most likely token, eliminating random creative outputs that could cause hallucination.
```
